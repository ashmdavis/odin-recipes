# Odin Recipes

## About Project
This projects is a simple website the lists popular meals and gives a step-by-step tutorial on how to make each dish. It is my first project with the Odin Project and also serves of as my way to review what I've already learned through other learning sources.

## Features
- A home page listing all available food dishes
- Each dish has its own detailed page which includes a description of the meal, the ingredients needed and a step-by step guidance on how to make each meal.

## What I've learned
I am already comfortable with the basics of HTML through other sources but I did learn how to use git with this project and how to clone a github repoistory onto my computer.
